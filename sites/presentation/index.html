                        Software development is messy, it's full of unknowns and compromises, and we tend to downplay how difficult it is to switch between teams or projects because admitting that your code is confusing carries the subtext that you're a bad developer, or worse:  incompetent.  But proficiency takes time.  Anecdotally, many software firms expect a developer to feel comfortable

                        - one year

                        This is a staggering amount of time, you basically don't know how productive someone will be until a year after you've hired them.  And during that time, you want developers to be learning the business, not struggling with technology.

                        And then the kicker, is that average employee tenure in IT is only 

                        - about three years.

                        But the current trend is to increase and abstract complexity, and farm out common functionality to third-party plugins.  Modern web development requires learning APIs and idiosyncracies for dozens of different APIs.  We usually only customize what really differentiates our business.  To place some context around this claim:

                        - modulecounts.com gives statistics on how many packages per day are added to popular package repositories, here are some numbers from September this year for popular web languages:

                        * go over numbers

                        Can anyone guess what npm is at?

                        - modulecounts.com tracks 470 new packages per day.

                        I don't know if I've made 470 distinct modules in my lifetime, and npm is growing at that number daily!  And this is reflective of the culture.  Modern websites are bundles of plugins, modules and frameworks with integrations written between them.  We abstract away as much as we can and because of the open source movement and these packaging platforms, we can share those abstractions with other people.

                        ...exasperation?

                        ...dread?

                        All three simultaneously?

                        The growth and availability of web technology is polarizing, and while I think it's important to be skeptical and cautious when adopting new technology or ideologies, we can't be curmudgeons, this is the present and future of web development.  We need to be objective and reject or accept something on its merits.

                        But if we accept that some of this technology is useful, we have to find ways to manage the ever-growing complexity of our websites.  We have to realize that software is not intuitive by default, and we have to be willing to adapt our processes and learn new paradigms, but also be thoughtful about integration, code sharing, and deployment.

                        DevOps has a lot of hidden depth, it's easy to understand at a glance but really adopting it permeates all aspects of your development workflow.  The word DevOps is a portmanteu of Development and Operations.  It's a fusing of both disciplines.

                        DevOps is taking ownership of your entire application, from development to deployment and monitoring.  
                        
                        It's never saying the phrase "it works on my machine."  
                        
                        It's aggressively removing manual processes, because manual processes introduce error and compartmentalize knowledge.  

                        This is a big topic, and we at Nazareth are a small team.  When I have too much decision and choice I tend to get decision paralysis.  So I've made a goal and I apply it to all aspects of my workflow.

                    <h2>sharing is caring</h2>
                    <aside class='notes'>
                        My test is:  am I making my application more shareable?  Shareability means other people can work on my code and contribute to it with low friction.  This has a trickle-down effect, and makes other aspects of deployment simpler.  But with this test, I can evaluate whether a new framework or technology is a good fit, and I can adjust the technology if it has other aspects I want but impacts shareability.

                    <aside class='notes'>
                        So at Nazareth, the question is no longer "should we use React," but "is our frontend solution (or lack of solution) affecting shareability?"  If the answer is yes, then we need to evaluate our frontend library, and use DevOps to ensure our project is shareable.

                        Before I talk about implementation, though, I want to go over shareability, and what I mean.  There's a big trend to try to make interactions obvious and intuitive in Web Development, and I think that's sort of a red herring.  All digital interactions are learned and imitated.  We're not born with the pinch to zoom reflex, we learned it once and now every touch device has to use it to be successful.

                        [http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/02/22/top-10-tuesday-worst-game-controllers]
                            
                        Another example is game controllers.  This is an alternate controller for the super nintendo.  It boasted a better D-PAD for your thumb so you'd get less muscle fatigue and turbo toggles for the buttons.  It was ranked as the ninth worst video game controller by IGN in 2006.  But it isn't inherently worse, it's just different and gamers had become used to the weight, fit and feel of the licensed gamepads.  They had learned familiarity and this gamepad violated too many of the ingrained habits gamers had developed.  It's not that a d-pad and buttons are the most intuitive way to interact with a game, users were just familiar with the classic super nintendo controller.

                        For reference, here's a rough outline of the classic controller from a similar perspective.

                        So to make our code more shareable within our team, we focus on 
                        
                        making projects feel familiar, regardless of the technologies used.  Developers should be able to move between projects with low friction because we've been thoughtful and intentional about how we build and package our application.  
                        
                        We do that by identifying common tasks and scripting them.  Starting a development server, creating and applying data migrations, importing test data, running unit tests, generating documentation, creating package distributions, etc... should be one script, not a series of documented or memorized commands.  
                        
                        The important piece, though, is creating the environment and dependencies necessary to run those scripts.

                        There are two mainstream approaches to managing dependencies automatically, one is configuration management through tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef to converge a system to a desired state.  This methodology reaches out to machines and adjusts them based on procedural steps or declarative state, I wish I had more time in this talk to go over this methodology more in-depth, but we honestly don't use configuration management tools very much except for initial configuration, to bootstrap VMs.  You typically use this solution on machines running multiple services that may or may not be related, so at Nazareth we have trouble ensuring we were responsibly configuring shared services, and we didn't know for certain what the dependencies were between services.

                        A simple example is what to set your web server's max connections to.  Two applications may want non-default values and they would compete and overwrite each other.

                        The other methodology is to embed all your dependencies alongside your application.  Desktop apps have been doing this for decades  This is the containerization philosophy, and we do this at Nazareth through Docker.  For example, your website becomes one stateless binary-like package that embeds PHP, an application server, dependencies like openssl/curl/libxml, and any helper scripts.  You then build your application declaratively and completely replace your application and dependencies each time you deploy, since everything is wrapped up in one package.

                        So we recognized that this is the way we want to build applications, and the technology we use to accomplish this is Docker.

                        Docker is mostly a wrapper over established technologies.  When starting out you can think of Docker as creating little lightweight virtual machines called images that run on the Docker platform.  They're not quite as isolated as a virtual machine but they're pretty self-contained and much more lightweight.  

                        You create Docker images through Docker file, and a Docker file is made up of commands followed by arguments.  There are around a dozen commands but you only really need about 4 to get started.

# Set the script that gets called when this image is run

                        This is a simple example, it creates an environment and runs a simple script.  Busyboxy is a lightweight base image that contains a lot of common UNIX utilities.

                        This image is now a standalone environment.  It can be called by its tag and nobody has to know the implementation details of the script.  It can also be compressed and sent to another developer and they can output the exact same train as you.

                        This image is now a standalone component.  You can use it to run PHP7 websites or scripts with community or custom extensions already installed.  A frontend developer doesn't have to worry about setting up their own environment and can focus on what's important to them.  This example works easily as well for something like Webpack.  You can set up a Webpack images with common elements like a TypeScript or SASS loader.

                        Now that we've looked at the basics of Docker, I want to share how Nazareth uses it.  We don't Dockerize individual components, we Dockerize entire logical applications and their build and development environments.  We have sort of replaced virtual machines with containers.  Having complete control over the environment means that I can easily make common interfaces to my containers that produce similar results but do very different things.  I can then compose those systems and make assumptions about how they work because of those standard interfaces.

                        Similar to the development side, we benefit from the consistency of the Docker platform.  All of our custom containers take a configuration file and custom Docker settings, like memory constraints, file mounts, port mappings, etc... But after the initial configuration, deployments are atomic and involve only updating the image.  At Nazareth we use Kubernetes, which manages scheduling containers to a cluster of servers and automatically scaling out services by creating additional instances, but it's just as effective to start Docker containers through scripts manually as well.
