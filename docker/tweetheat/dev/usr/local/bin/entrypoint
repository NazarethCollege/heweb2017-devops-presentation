You are now in a build container.  This container provides
the environment necessary to build and test the application.

The following commands have been added to the path:

    dev.run-tests               Runs unit tests for the webserver
    dev.work-on-backend         Recompiles and starts the go server at port 8080
    dev.work-on-frontend        Starts webserver and webpack and compiles 
                                the output to /workspace/build

A typical workflow will be to execute unit tests

    dev.run-tests

Then test the endpoint manually

    dev.work-on-backend

After you have verified the backend works, you'll want to work on the UI

    dev.work-on-frontend
